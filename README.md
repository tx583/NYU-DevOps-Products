## Daily Standup

Hints: checkout the detail in chapter 3 ppt

### skeleton about daily standup

- Occurs every day at the same time and place
- Called a "standup" because everyone should remain standing during the meeting to keep it short
  - Timeboxed to 15 minutes
  - Not a project status meeting â€” all status should be tabled for later discussion
- Each team member briefly reports on their work

### Daily Standup Question

- Each team member answers three questions:
  - What did I accomplish the previous day?
  - What will I work on today?
  - What blockers or impediments are in my way?

### Daily Execution

- Take the next highest priority item from the Sprint Backlog
- Assign it to yourself
- Start working on it
- No one should have more than one story assigned to them unless they are blocked and want to start a second story while waiting
- When you are finished, move the Story to the Done column
